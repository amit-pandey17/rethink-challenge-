# Rethink Plaintext Editing: Challenge Accepted!
## update: Challenge Completed!

This is an honest effort from my end and I have solved what I was expected to (at least what I thought I was expected to)

1. Plaintext editor: I have integrated the facebook's Draft.js library into this and I have created the run of the mill editor in the editing area. You may see some cluttered stuff like H1, H2, Italics, bold etc all smushed together but I promise you it works. Click below the "tell a story" and you will find the blinking cursor.
    - Drawbacks: I tried to integrate the example css design template provided by facebook but for some reason it doesn't embed with my js code.

2. Markdown editor: I have used the react-markdown library in this section of the question asked: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown. I went through their documentation to have an idea of how to use this and it was pretty straightforward. Start typing in the textbox and you will see the code in action.
    - I tried to use the syntax highlighter to highlight the reserved keywords of various languages, but it was crashing the whole application and hence I decided to let it be. But just letting this out that I wanted to execute the highlighting without the hiccups I got.

I want to thank the Rethink engineering team to have given me the opportunity to do this exercise. I got to use the libraries I had never used (actually never heard of them before) and honestly it was a really fulfulling and rewarding experience. I hope to get further guidance to hone my skills.
